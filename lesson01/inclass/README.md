Topic:Rent-A-Drive

Purpose : 
Often times,we just want to rent a car for a weekend or a trip with our friends.The only option we have is to reach out to the expensive car rental 
companies.On the other hand, as car owners,their cars are not always used and are parked in garage.

My project is about creating an ecosystem to connect car-owners with customers effectively so that this problem can be solved.

I would be using Google APIs and Youtube APIs for better user experiences.

There are 4 modules in this project:
1.New User Signup Page - Whenever a new user enters the system,They have to create new login details. 
2.Add New Car - Car owner has to insert car details into the system along with its pictures. 
3.Main Page View - First Page with a grid view of cars,where renter can search according to there preferences.
4.Cart View - This is the page where renter has shortlisted the cars to choose before contacting the owner.
5.Email Alert - After selecting the car an email request is generated to Car owner,explaining that there is renter for there car and they can contact them if they like.
6.Google Maps - This view involoves google maps APIs,where car owner can always the location of there car after renting it for security reasons.
7.Customer Ratings and Review - At the end when renter has returned the car,they can leave there ratings and reviews based on there experiences.
8.Payment View - On this page we can make the payment online.
